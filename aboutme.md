hello! i'm alice, currently a 2nd year @ uchicago studying physics, math, and probably a whole host of other things. this website serves as a soapbox for me to waffle about topics such as:

- quantum information science
- computational linguistics
- folk music
- medieval art
- the future (!!)

my cv can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/vxkxvmtxsczf#c705a0).
