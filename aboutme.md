hello! i'm alice, currently a 1st year @ uchicago studying physics, math, linguistics, and probably a whole host of other things. this website serves as a soapbox for me to waffle about topics such as:

- quantum information science
- computational linguistics
- folk music
- medieval art
- the future (!!)

my cv can be found here.
