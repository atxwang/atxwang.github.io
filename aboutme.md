hello! i'm alice, currently a 2nd year @ uchicago studying physics, math, and probably a whole host of other things. this website serves as a soapbox for me to opine and waffle about topics such as:

- pop culture and society
- personal happenings
- travel
- folk art, music, random other semi-niche interests

if needed, my cv can be found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/vxkxvmtxsczf#c705a0).
