no shock here: Kamala won the debate, partly to do with a good (better than expected) showing on her part, but mostly overshadowed by Trump's insanely horrific performance.

much hoopla has already been made about Trump's [many lies and fumbles](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/11/g-s1-21932/fact-check-trump-harris-presidential-debate-2024) throughout the debate. it is clear that he lost on substance, but Trump was never liked for substance. he was liked for *style*, for catchy witticisms that can be parroted by 4chan edgelords and z-list rappers. and he lost on that! he's losing his swagger, and has been for a long time. take a look at his tweets, compared between the onset/duration of his previous candidacy/presidency and now:

now

am i cherrypicking? sure. but having observed his twitter feed for a while, he just doesn't write bangers anymore! Trump's older tweets were terse, funny, and immensely quotable---"many such cases" is still a meme tagline today. his newer ones, with no aid from the longer character limit, read like meandering screeds. "crooked Hillary" and "very very disrespectful" are catchy and memorable, whereas no one left of Trump himself cares about the half-hearted insults of "comrade Kamala" or "tampon Tim". 

Trump's most outspoken supporters, the ones who propelled him to his 2016 victory, used to be the young, cool-talking internetlords who helped "unite the right" at Charlottesville (the neo-Nazi rally that he struggled to disavow last night). they were the ones who truly appreciated how his old style of brash simplicity got the moderate left seething in a way they could get people to laugh at. they used the charming absurdity of his words to meme him into office, all under an icky film of detached irony. this bloc, and the alluring energy it provided, no longer exists. [the right has fractured, much in the same way the left did](https://damagemag.com/2024/08/21/how-the-online-right-fell-apart/). the remaining faces of MAGA are the petite bourgeois baby boomers railing at facebook
