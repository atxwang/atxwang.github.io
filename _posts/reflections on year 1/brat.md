has there ever been a cultural phenomenon more memefied, pervasive, and celebrated than Charli xcx's *BRAT*?  Charli's greatest critical and commercial success yet has not only launched her from underground idol to mainstream star but also metastasized its way into every information highway of our consumption-obsessed culture. "brat" has become a meaningless, superficial signaling word for some archetypal cool girl/gay. "brat summer" means parties and poppers, "brat green" means matcha and margaritas. "brat" is a catch all icon, an [advertising catchphrase](https://www.delish.com/food-news/a61500647/field-roast-brat-wurst-charli-xcx/), [tiktok trend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLe0YHj6HCI), and the [democratic party's 2024 presidential campaign anthem](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/how-vice-president-kamala-harris-became-brat/). how the fuck did we get here?

even before the brat explosion, Charli xcx had become memeified as a (not quite) "main pop girl", a revered herald of a new kind of future pop unlistenable to all but a select group of rabid twink fans. this image of her is not false but instead incomplete. Charli's music is of course sassy and experimental, a mix of danceably ecstatic energy and metallic clanging, but also raw, confessional, bitter, self-loathing. at heart, Charli is as much of a self-obsessed sad girl as Phoebe Bridgers, she just cries in the club instead of at the funeral. 

unfiltered nature of the disavowed debut album *14* aside, Charli's earliest influences were post punk and new wave--Siouxsie Sioux, The Cure, etc.--the ur-examples of depression and angst with a driving groove. *True Romance* delivers something like 80's New Order's take on 90's cybergoth raves with driving synths and sawtooth bass. the lyrics throughout depict the desperate cling to a tumultuous relationship in which Charli seems to keep fucking up or falling victim to manipulation, Bizarre Love Triangle-style. she cheats,  he cheats, she lies, he lies, she can't resist crawling back and the cycle repeats. safe to say, her persona here is far from morally enviable.

**cult classic but i still pop**

following the punk-influenced yet heavily commercial *Sucker*, Charli began the most pivotal (but unrecognized) phase of her career.

enter PC Music, the art-school-famous British label helmed by AG Cook (who would become Charli's creative director) and closely tied to the late Sophie Xeon. "personal computer music" was not the pop music of the future, as the media so often dubbed it, but instead the music of the present. PC Music thrived in a perpetual state of contradiction---depending on who was asked, PC Music was either an irony tinged and cynical critique of 2010s-era technocapitalism or a genuine, love-borne attempt at emulating "recession pop" and mass consumerist culture. really, it was both.

of course, PC Music reveled in this confusion, and in classic internet fashion, trolling was a big aspect of their early output:

accordingly, i feel that a major goal of PC Music was to get their surrealist, often dark and cynical music into consumer culture and mass advertising. SOPHIE's Lemonade---a song with nonsense repetitive lyrics with a tinge of darkness---made its way into McDonald's ads, and she later produced for Madonna in a song widely declared to be a last sad, desperate cling to fading youth.

the ur-example of this is QT, a collaboration between AG and SOPHIE as faceless producers, Harriet Pittard as uncredited vocalist, and Hayden Dunham/"Quinn Thomas" as plastic face. QT was the fake popstar whose only single Hey QT had the sole purpose of advertising the fake energy drink DrinkQT and took over the world with a bouncy beat barely obscuring some honest-to-god scary lyrics---the chorus is "i feel your hands on my body/every time you think of me".

Charli, SOPHIE, and AG would experiment with a more mainstream version of this weird, off-putting style, putting out some controversially-received EPs in anticipation of her third album, XCXWorld. yet plagued by leaks and label disapproval for its bold experimentation, Charli's would-be magnum opus was scrapped.

**dial 999 it's a good time**
-
- since the beginnign of her work with PC, charli's lyrics were more introspective, self-blaming, and less irony-poisoned (ie. track 10, no angel, def more esamples lol)
- her more straightforward PC sounds were heavily collab based
- hifn is the protobrat because it's her first completely solo project with more abrasive sounds (following 2020s late hyperpop trends) and introspective focused
- this kind of naturally faded with sophie's death and the death of "hyperpop" into the crash era

**i guess the apple don't fall far from the tree**

brat is an ode to that era and to the remnants of xcxworld. so i, spring breakers, club classics all harken back to that era and sound. brat is so online, so focused on random online pop girl drama like von dutch and girl, so confusing. so focused on random online figures like with mean girls and 360, everything in pinterest boards like everything is romantic. 

but this is not a positive thing. the brat character is so online, so self obsessive and self destructive, this is a continuation of charli's mentally ill party girl. i might say something stupid, sympathy is a knife, and b2b are so pathetic. von dutch is mean spirited, apple is juvenile. she so desperately wants to mature (i think about it all the time) but falls back into destruction, hedonism, hard drugs (365). this is why no political controversy involving charli matters, her connections with red scare or dasha don't matter bc she's not even attempting to portray an admirable character. mean girls is tongue in cheek, she's so intelligent isn't she...

and yet the bops go so hard, the songs are so danceable, they're all club classics, so people don't notice. this is why the brat marketing and memes are so effective. they so aggressively appeal to the superficial visual layer and none of the underneath. and that's why they've become the anthem of the democratic party and the kamala harris campaign. and also why charli tweeting "kamala is brat" has layers of imperceptible irony behind it. the pipeline from genuine appreciation to ironic memeification back to genuine again but with a corporate machine face. this is the ultimate victory of personal computer music.
