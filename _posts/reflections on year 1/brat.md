has there ever been a cultural phenomenon more memefied, pervasive, and celebrated than Charli xcx's *BRAT*?  Charli's greatest critical and commercial success yet has not only launched her from underground idol to mainstream star but also metastasized its way into every information highway of our consumption-obsessed culture. "brat" has become a meaningless, superficial signaling word for some archetypal cool girl/gay. "brat summer" means parties and poppers, "brat green" means matcha and margaritas. "brat" is a catch all icon, an [advertising catchphrase](https://www.delish.com/food-news/a61500647/field-roast-brat-wurst-charli-xcx/), [tiktok trend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLe0YHj6HCI), and the [democratic party's 2024 presidential campaign anthem](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/how-vice-president-kamala-harris-became-brat/). how the fuck did we get here?

*charlixcx as an artist makes sad girl bops. club anthems about hating yourself and wanting to leave. of course she was influenced by punk and post punk ie. the cure's kiss me kiss me kiss me as well as artists like robyn. examples: gone, the near entirety of how i'm feeling now*

even before the brat explosion, Charli xcx had become memeified as a (not quite) "main pop girl", a revered herald of a new kind of future pop unlistenable to all but a select group of rabid twink fans. this image of her is not false but instead incomplete. Charli's music is of course sassy and experimental, a mix of danceably ecstatic energy and metallic clanging, but also raw, confessional, bitter, self-loathing. at heart, Charli is as much of a sad girl as Phoebe Bridgers, she just cries in the club instead of at the funeral. 

unfiltered nature of the disavowed debut album *14* aside, Charli's earliest influences were punk, post punk, and new wave--Siouxsie Sioux, The Cure, etc.--the ur-examples of depression and angst with a driving groove. *True Romance* delivers something like 80's New Order's take on 90's cybergoth with driving synths and sawtooth bass, and lyrics throughout on desperately

enter pc music. personal computer music, not the pop music of the future but the music of the present. irony tinged and cynical, critique of technocapitalism is central, but also filled with genuine love for mass consumerist culture, just look at gfoty. everything dialed up, exaggerated by a thousand times. a genre dormant with sophie's death and the rise of shallow emo spoof "hyperpop". the ultimate goal of pc music was to get their dark and cynical lyrics into consumer culture and mass advertising. hey qt is the ur example, just listen to the lyrics. but also lemonade in mcdonalds ads, bitch im madonna, etc... this is the genre which was supposed to but never did manifest in xcxworld.

brat is an ode to that era and to the remnants of xcxworld. so i, spring breakers, club classics all harken back to that era and sound. brat is so online, so focused on random online pop girl drama like von dutch and girl, so confusing. so focused on random online figures like with mean girls and 360, everything in pinterest boards like everything is romantic. 

but this is not a positive thing. the brat character is so online, so self obsessive and self destructive, this is a continuation of charli's mentally ill party girl. i might say something stupid, sympathy is a knife, and b2b are so pathetic. von dutch is mean spirited, apple is juvenile. she so desperately wants to mature (i think about it all the time) but falls back into destruction, hedonism, hard drugs (365). this is why no political controversy involving charli matters, her connections with red scare or dasha don't matter bc she's not even attempting to portray an admirable character. mean girls is tongue in cheek, she's so intelligent isn't she...

and yet the bops go so hard, the songs are so danceable, they're all club classics, so people don't notice. this is why the brat marketing and memes are so effective. they so aggressively appeal to the superficial visual layer and none of the underneath. and that's why they've become the anthem of the democratic party and the kamala harris campaign. and also why charli tweeting "kamala is brat" has layers of imperceptible irony behind it. the pipeline from genuine appreciation to ironic memeification back to genuine again but with a corporate machine face. this is the ultimate victory of personal computer music.
