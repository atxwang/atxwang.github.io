brat has become an almost meaningless, superficial signaling word for parties, poppers, hedonism. it has become a catch all icon in advertising[bratwurst] and overton window american politics[kamala harris campaign]. how the fuck did this happen?

charlixcx as an artist makes sad girl bops. club anthems about hating yourself and wanting to leave. of course she was influenced by punk and post punk ie. the cure.

enter pc music. personal computer music, not the pop music of the future but the music of the present. irony tinged and cynical, critique of modern but also filled with genuine love for mass consumerist culture, just look at gfoty. a genre dormant with sophie's death and the rise of shallow emo spoof "hyperpop".
