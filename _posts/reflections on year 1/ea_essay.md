*this essay was started in march following the 2024 midwest EA retreat. unfortunately, i am both very lazy and very busy which means i did not finish this up until now! :p*

**i  feel that i have a very unique vantage point on effective altruism**. as a teenager i was one of those really annoying socialists---i had first heard of EA through the FTX/Sam Bankman-Fried debacle, a cascade of disasters that i observed with digital popcorn in hand, and i saw it as just another turn to private charity meant to justify the inherent inequalities of capitalism ala Carnegie's *Gospel of Wealth*. i saw the movement as populated by libertarian, race realist weirdos like Caroline Ellison, whose unsurprisingly-defunct [Tumblr blog](https://caroline.milkyeggs.com/worldoptimization) is worth a baffledly-amused read. 

yet as i started college, more and more i found myself reading EA blogs, doing EA fellowships, and participating in EA causes. i recently attended an EA "retreat", which i found rewarding, although exhausting---EA people (myself included) are usually stubborn and single minded, very often "neurodivergent", or somehow socially off-putting to most of the population. there's certainly truth to the idea that EA has somewhat of a r/iamverysmart superiority complex and a harmful fixation on quantifying moral realities. the stereotype is that EAs care little for political action, relying on the inherently fallible system of private charity as a primary means to "do good". in some ways, the attendees of the retreat represented these impulses, but they were also highly curious and passionate people whose dedication to the movement stemmed from rarely high levels of genuine empathy. i feel that these characteristics, representative of every EA i've personally met, are rarely mentioned in non EAs' critiques.

my post here is intended to reconcile these perspectives: i argue that **although EA is a flawed movement and in many ways a flawed ideology, there is a significant number of people whose greatest potential benefits to society are unleashed through EA**---hence, EA's instrumental value is hugely underrated by non EAs. by sharing aspects of EA i believe to be underdiscussed outside the movement, i hope to provide both EAs and non EAs a better idea of how best to move forward with their altruism---"effective" or not.

**What do we do with STEM majors?**
-
everyone has been decrying the death of the humanities since the 80s, and that in itself is an essay post all on its own. the point is that as a result of this decline of humanistic thinking on every level of schooling, more and more people funneled into elite institutions---universities, companies, etc.---

1) enter university (or even high school!!) with the specific goal of breaking into prestigious, lucrative money-moving careers (ie. quant, IB) that don't do much but passively harm the world.
2) lack and are not given a humanities foundation, which (hot take) teaches important things like ethics, moral philosophy, historical contextualization for current society, etc.
3) think far more quantitatively than qualitatively.

given this, it's no surprise that the philosophy of EA---a movement populated in large part by STEM students and graduates---can feel immature to well-read humanist outsiders. EA is founded on impartial utilitarianism, statistics, expected values---the same factors drawing its adherents are what makes it seem [cold, ghoulishly detached](https://thespinoff.co.nz/politics/08-04-2019/in-search-of-a-way-to-do-good-that-amounts-to-more-than-feeling-good), [hypercapitalist](https://jacobin.com/2023/01/effective-altruism-longtermism-nick-bostrom-racism). these are of course valid criticisms, but the non-EA should remember that not everyone---especially not the types of STEM majors i'm describing---is willing to dedicate themselves to principled socialist activism or whatever. rather, they want high salaries and tractable data---more achievable under an EA-lens than a conventionally left-wing one. pushing these people away from their innate conceptions of the world will only make them want to do altruism less. it sucks that so many people carry this rather reductive view of the world, but the bar is on the floor /hj. plus, let's be honest---this kind of quantitative analysis is sorely missing from the leftist variants of altruism, like mutual aid.

everyone agrees that a plurality of society's smartest young people should not be striving for lives as consultants or weapons engineers, and until something better comes along (to name one aspect, a total restructuring of higher education), EA seems like the best way to achieve that.

**EA at its best is altruistic networking**
-
a common criticism of EA is its status as a ["shell game"](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/the-effective-altruism-shell-game)---EA is a vacuous rebranding of utilitarianism, and thus has nothing new to offer but fanciful nerd debates. i won't pretend that this isn't a large portion of EA's novelty, but i think an important refutation to this criticism is EA's emphasis on effective careers.

the primary example of this would be the non-profit 80,000 hours, which (afaik) has no real analogue in other movements. you can criticize 80k for many things, but there's no denying that it's [redirected countless people to dedicate their careers towards altruism](https://80000hours.org/about/impact/). even though the conceit of 80k is fundamentally true, i think many people are superficially put off by the premise of making life decisions primarily based on coldly quantified measures of "impact", rather than love or passion. but for the people willing to sign up for 80k consulting---many considering jobs already motivated far more by salary than love or impact---this type of guidance is really useful. personally, i would take one earn-to-giver or AI alignment researcher over any number of disposable finance bros or web developers.

even beyond organized efforts like 80k, which can be rather polarizing, i think EA as a conglomerate offers quite a lot of value in mentorship, learning resources, networking, etc. if you're considering a career in say, biorisk or emerging technology, all you have to do is put yourself out there and multiple EAs in that field will have a comprehensive collection of adjacent resources and connections to share to you. maybe this kind of thing doesn't need the "effective altruism" label, but i'm honestly unsure if it would exist in the capacity it does without the big tent EA movement behind it.

of course, this "networking with a cause" isn't the only major value of EA. 

**Veganism--- "ethical consumption"**
-
this might be a nuclear take, but i think one of the greatest failures of the modern left (especially the environmental left) is the lack of attention on veganism.

**Longtermism, philosophy, and more opaque benefits**
