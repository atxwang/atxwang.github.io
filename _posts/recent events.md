**to the ones who walk away**

be swift resolute proud let immovable strides carry you
past poppy fields past fig trees past clear skies where in lieu of soaring kites there is terrifying rain
past border walls past stones and slingshots past the cages in which human animals are detained

past glorious gates standing valiantly in defense against that terrible paradox: a child

suffering

screaming

and as you stride the ones who stay behind trip on bones jutting out from the soil---
---grasping limbs they refuse to see

**i didn't want this to be my first post.** i had a well-argued essay on effective altruism in the backburner. i was writing a reflection about crime and empathy, another post on a funny find at a hole-in-the-wall chicago ethnic museum. 

i didn't want this to be my first post. it's not well-organized---it is scattered, vulnerable. it is a barely curated collection of my own shitty writing, articles and essays i keep rereading and reading, memories i have on replay constantly. angry unformed thoughts coalesce. 

everyone believes they are empathetic, altruistic on some fundamental level. yet statistics, history, headlines---the pure *mass* of things---blind us. it is human nature to only start caring when you hear the bombs fall--not *on* you, because they never will, because you are not a victim and you will always be a few degrees removed from the people who really are--but near you, just a bit too close, the screaming, the explosions are just a *tad teensy bit too uncomfortably loud*--so you clutch your pearls and finally say something to the snide effect of "hey folx, maybe bombing is *bad*." here, i cleverly reveal my hand and confess that i, too, am one of these self-centered, impotent, pearl-clutchers bravely volunteering myself into a chorus that has begun to sing 75 years too late. my writing is selfish too--- i'm aware that it may as well not be read by anyone but me, it is simply a way for me alone to "make sense of things", and so i might as well write about something funny or something that makes me happy, yet over months over weeks over days all i can keep thinking is

three degrees removed from families displaced from people killed probably i don't know but probably and if they were it was probably brutal two degrees removed from the tackled violently arrested someone's mother someone's brother someone's friend someone shot and paralyzed a toddler murdered only an american one this time one degree removed one degree removed one degree removed one degree one degree removed 

i didn't want this to be my first post. i yell into the void undeterred, hearing only an echo.

Show me the ruins of buildings once so tall,

You and I,
There but for fortune, go you or go I -- you and I."

i saw a sign at yesterday's counterprotest that read **"self-defense is not genocide"**. the girl who brandished it---whose face i recognized from club meetings, from campus-wide events, from mailing lists, because we are both students, about the same age, at the same university--was putting on a show, dancing, clapping, smiling, as if to say "you are trying to destroy me and i will happily prevail." she is correct, of course, that on some theoretical hypothetical definitional level, indeed, definitionally, self-defense is not genocide, definitionally, what is happening in gaza currently may or may not be a genocide, and definitionally, we can run around in circles before every reaching any semblance of a point. 

"self-defense is not genocide." the words linger in my head like a terrible, thick miasma of thought.  i've seen them before, plastered on op-eds, on acquaintances' social media profiles, for months. but something about the smugness, the shit-eating condescension, the seeming joy and *blatant lack of shame* taken in projecting such an innocuous phrase with all its underhanded implications, scorches itself into the surface of my brain and does not leave.

"self-defense is not genocide." **Dr. Refaat Alareer**, 

"self-defense is not genocide." **Masoud al-Qutati**,

"self-defense is not genocide." **Elham Farah**,

"self-defense is not genocide." **Hind Rajab**, whose name is now most associated with some ill-defined idea of misguided teenage rebellion instead of the six-year-old girl it actually belonged to, was murdered mercilessly by gunfire from israeli tanks along with the rest of her family while escaping gaza city. her final words were spoken during a call with the red cross--"i'm so scared, please come. come take me. please, will you come?"--before israeli missiles destroyed the very ambulance bringing her aid.

**selected commentaries**
> "The five-month massacre in Gaza is not collateral damage, or an unfortunate side effect of the war against Hamas. There is no war against Hamas. Just this. The only military objective is to kill piano teachers and poets...
> "More famine! More disease! More stillborn children! They think they’re being brave too. The arctic glint of righteousness in their eyes...
> "Generation after generation of children, throwing themselves into the path of one of the most brutal military machines in human history, smashing their skulls against its steel hull, mangling their limbs in its treads, thousands of them, for seventy-five years, destroying themselves as they try to face down an engine that simply rolls on over the dying and the dead."

--Sam Kriss, [Against the brave](https://samkriss.substack.com/p/against-the-brave), a meditation on the destruction and futility of martyrdom and victimhood

> "The city with the good fruit and the good bread has been turned into a stateless cyberpunk horrorscape, the bad dream of modernity, a zone of continually expanding human biomass...
> "Better one single holocaust on our conscience than the unlimited ethical demand to protect the life and wellbeing of every fruit fly on the planet. Better that than having to think about every conscious being who ended up smeared into a dot of brown paste across the palm of your hand."

--Sam Kriss, [Bread, figs, phosphorous](https://samkriss.substack.com/p/bread-figs-phosphorus), an elegy for the former "intellectual centre of the world"

> "Anyone who gave the slightest hint of getting excited or anxious was tossed to the ground and handcuffed there—I saw four or five students doing civil disobedience thrown to the ground, and I've seen videos on social media of other students arrested that way...
> "Public higher education has been increasingly corporatized for decades. There are those who think that it is more about parochial education to prepare students to be in the workforce than it is about the intellectual development of wonderful people to be part of our society."

-- [an interview with Josh Dubnau](https://hellgatenyc.com/state-troopers-stony-brook-university-protester-crackdown), an SBU professor arrested in recent protests, on censorship in higher education and police brutality against civil disobedience

> "When you shoot an arrow at a target, first it goes halfway, then three fourths of the way, the seven eighths, etc. and because there is infinite distance between zero and one, it’s strange that the arrow ever hits the target. I’m saying there that McWhorter is doing a similar exercise for moral commitment, there will always be some moral ambiguity or complexity between him and the condemnation of Israel, and so the arrow never has to hit the target."

> "Nor is it acceptable to argue that slogans such as “from the river to the sea” imply violence. After all, the same language is in the founding charter of Israel’s ruling Likud party, whose express policy is that Palestinians will never have a state, and which actually has implemented this single-state vision in the present...
> "The secular sainthood of such individuals is always a retrospective phenomenon, arising after their challenges have passed and they can be safely canonized. In their own time, they were more [widely hated than loved](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/10/how-public-attitudes-toward-martin-luther-king-jr-have-changed-since-the-1960s/), and it was common for opponents to represent them as apostles of violence and intimidation. 'The old violence parades today in a new uniform,' said Richard Nixon in a 1968 campaign speech critical of the civil rights movement."
