**to the ones who walk away**

be swift resolute proud let immovable strides carry you
past poppy fields past fig trees past clear skies where in lieu of soaring kites there is terrifying rain
past border walls past 

past gilded gates guarding them from a child

suffering

screaming

and as you stride the ones left behind trip on bones jutting out from the soil---
---grasping limbs they refuse to see
