**Scattered Thoughts on Recent Events**


**to the ones who walk away**

be swift resolute proud let immovable strides carry you
past poppy fields past fig trees past 
past gilded gates guarding them from a child

and as you stride the ones left behind trip on bones jutting out from the soil---
---grasping limbs they refuse to see
