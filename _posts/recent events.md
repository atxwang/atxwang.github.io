**to the ones who walk away**

be swift resolute proud let immovable strides carry you
past poppy fields past fig trees past clear skies where in lieu of soaring kites there is terrifying rain
past border walls past stones and slingshots past cages in which human animals are detained

past glorious gates stood valiantly in defense against that terrible paradox, a child

suffering

screaming

and as you stride the ones who stay behind trip on bones jutting out from the soil---
---grasping limbs they refuse to see

**selected quotes**

> "Remember the stranger among you, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt." 

-- Exodus 22:21

> "Show me the country where bombs had to fall,
Show me the ruins of buildings once so tall,
And I'll show you a young land with so many reasons why
There but for fortune, go you or go I -- you and I.
You and I,
There but for fortune, go you or go I -- you and I."

--Phil Ochs, "There But for Fortune"

> "I couldnâ€™t see making them sit and listen to this as if it were background music." 

-- John McWhorter, butchering John Cage's 4'33"

**selected commentaries**
> "The five-month massacre in Gaza is not collateral damage, or an unfortunate side effect of the war against Hamas. There is no war against Hamas. Just this. The only military objective is to kill piano teachers and poets...
> "Generation after generation of children, throwing themselves into the path of one of the most brutal military machines in human history, smashing their skulls against its steel hull, mangling their limbs in its treads, thousands of them, for seventy-five years, destroying themselves as they try to face down an engine that simply rolls on over the dying and the dead."

--Sam Kriss, [Against the brave](https://samkriss.substack.com/p/against-the-brave), a meditation on the destruction and futility of martyrdom

> 
> "Better one single holocaust on our conscience than the unlimited ethical demand to protect the life and wellbeing of every fruit fly on the planet. Better that than having to think about every conscious being who ended up smeared into a dot of brown paste across the palm of your hand."
