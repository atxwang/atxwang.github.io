**to the ones who walk away**

be swift resolute proud let immovable strides carry you
past poppy fields past fig trees past clear skies where in lieu of soaring kites there is terrifying rain
past border walls past stones and slingshots past cages in which human animals are detained

past glorious gates standing valiantly in defense against that terrible paradox: a child

suffering

screaming

and as you stride the ones who stay behind trip on bones jutting out from the soil---
---grasping limbs they refuse to see

**selected quotes**

> "Remember the stranger among you, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt." 

-- Exodus 22:21

> "Show me the country where bombs had to fall,
Show me the ruins of buildings once so tall,
And I'll show you a young land with so many reasons why
There but for fortune, go you or go I -- you and I.
You and I,
There but for fortune, go you or go I -- you and I."

--Phil Ochs, "There But for Fortune"

> "I couldn’t see making them sit and listen to this as if it were background music." 

-- John McWhorter, butchering John Cage's 4'33"

---
**selected commentaries**
> "The five-month massacre in Gaza is not collateral damage, or an unfortunate side effect of the war against Hamas. There is no war against Hamas. Just this. The only military objective is to kill piano teachers and poets...
> "Generation after generation of children, throwing themselves into the path of one of the most brutal military machines in human history, smashing their skulls against its steel hull, mangling their limbs in its treads, thousands of them, for seventy-five years, destroying themselves as they try to face down an engine that simply rolls on over the dying and the dead."

--Sam Kriss, [Against the brave](https://samkriss.substack.com/p/against-the-brave), a meditation on the destruction and futility of martyrdom

> "The city with the good fruit and the good bread has been turned into a stateless cyberpunk horrorscape, the bad dream of modernity, a zone of continually expanding human biomass...
> "Better one single holocaust on our conscience than the unlimited ethical demand to protect the life and wellbeing of every fruit fly on the planet. Better that than having to think about every conscious being who ended up smeared into a dot of brown paste across the palm of your hand."

--Sam Kriss, [Bread, figs, phosphorous](https://samkriss.substack.com/p/bread-figs-phosphorus), an elegy for the former "intellectual centre of the world"

> "Anyone who gave the slightest hint of getting excited or anxious was tossed to the ground and handcuffed there—I saw four or five students doing civil disobedience thrown to the ground, and I've seen videos on social media of other students arrested that way...
> "Public higher education has been increasingly corporatized for decades. There are those who think that it is more about parochial education to prepare students to be in the workforce than it is about the intellectual development of wonderful people to be part of our society."

-- [an interview with Josh Dubnau](https://hellgatenyc.com/state-troopers-stony-brook-university-protester-crackdown), SBU professor arrested in recent protests, on censorship in higher education and police brutality against civil disobedience

> "When you shoot an arrow at a target, first it goes halfway, then three fourths of the way, the seven eighths, etc. and because there is infinite distance between zero and one, it’s strange that the arrow ever hits the target. I’m saying there that McWhorter is doing a similar exercise for moral commitment, there will always be some moral ambiguity or complexity between him and the condemnation of Israel, and so the arrow never has to hit the target."
