**to the ones who walk away**

be swift resolute proud let immovable strides carry you
past poppy fields past fig trees past clear skies where in lieu of soaring kites there is terrifying rain
past border walls past stones and slingshots past cages in which human animals are detained

past glorious gates stood valiantly in defense against that terrible paradox, a child

suffering

screaming

and as you stride the ones who stay behind trip on bones jutting out from the soil---
---grasping limbs they refuse to see

**selected quotes**

> "Remember the stranger among you, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt." 

-- Exodus 22:21

> "Show me the country where bombs had to fall,
Show me the ruins of buildings once so tall,
And I'll show you a young land with so many reasons why
There but for fortune, go you or go I -- you and I.
You and I,
There but for fortune, go you or go I -- you and I."

--Phil Ochs, "There But for Fortune"

> "I couldnâ€™t see making them sit and listen to this as if it were background music." 

-- John McWhorter, missing the point of John Cage's 4'33"
