**i sometimes feel that i have a very unique vantage point on effective altruism**. as a teenager i was one of *those* really annoying socialists (as opposed to the only moderately annoying socialist i am now). i had first heard of EA through the FTX/Sam Bankman-Fried debacle, a cascade of disasters that i observed with digital popcorn in hand, and i saw it as just another turn to private charity meant to justify the inherent inequalities of capitalism ala Carnegie's *Gospel of Wealth*. i saw the movement as populated by libertarian, race realist weirdos like The Caroline Ellison Herself, whose unsurprisingly-defunct [Tumblr blog](https://caroline.milkyeggs.com/worldoptimization) is worth a baffledly-amused read. 

yet i continue to find myself reading EA/EA-adjacent blogs and doing every fellowship in my college's EA branch, all while being the token staunch EA critic. this has culminated in my participation in an EA "retreat", which i found rewarding but uniquely exhausting compared to my fellow attendees. there, i witnessed firsthand some of the most cartoonishly-negative stereotypes of EA:
- multiple regular soylent drinkers
- people who could feasibly be called climate change deniers
- militant vegans
- literally only 2 other women (out of ~15 attendees)- *this became comical because i did not bring shower products, and the default backup provided was one of those memed-on 3 in 1 body wash/shampoo/conditioner things*

i also met some very cool, dedicated, passionate people who reinvigorated my willingness to "do good". the intersection of this group with the aforementioned negative stereotypes was non-zero. i guess what i'm saying is **i feel confident enough now to defend EA's instrumental value to my fellow EA haters.**
