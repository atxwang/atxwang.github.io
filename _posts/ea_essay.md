**i  feel that i have a very unique vantage point on effective altruism**. as a teenager i was one of those really annoying socialists (as opposed to the only moderately annoying socialist i am now). i had first heard of EA through the FTX/Sam Bankman-Fried debacle, a cascade of disasters that i observed with digital popcorn in hand, and i saw it as just another turn to private charity meant to justify the inherent inequalities of capitalism ala Carnegie's *Gospel of Wealth*. i saw the movement as populated by libertarian, race realist weirdos like The Caroline Ellison Herself, whose unsurprisingly-defunct [Tumblr blog](https://caroline.milkyeggs.com/worldoptimization) is worth a baffledly-amused read. 

yet i continue to find myself reading EA blogs, doing EA fellowships, and participating in EA causes. i recently attended an EA "retreat", which i found rewarding, although exhausting---EA people are usually stubborn and single minded, very often autistic or somehow socially off-putting to most of the population. there's certainly truth to the idea that EA has somewhat of a r/iamverysmart superiority complex and a harmful fixation on quantifying moral realities. of course, many EAs care little for political action, relying on the inherently fallible system of private charity as a primary means to "do good". in some ways, the attendees of the retreat (myself included) represented these impulses, but they were also highly curious and passionate people whose dedication to the movement stemmed from rarely high levels of genuine empathy. i feel that these characteristics, representive of every EA i've personally met, are rarely mentioned in non EAs' critiques.

my post here is intended to reconcile these perspectives: i argue that although (of course) EA is a flawed movement and in many ways a flawed ideology, there is a specific type of person whose greatest potential benefit to society
