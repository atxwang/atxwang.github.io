**i  feel that i have a very unique vantage point on effective altruism**. as a teenager i was one of those really annoying socialists (as opposed to the only moderately annoying socialist i am now). i had first heard of EA through the FTX/Sam Bankman-Fried debacle, a cascade of disasters that i observed with digital popcorn in hand, and i saw it as just another turn to private charity meant to justify the inherent inequalities of capitalism ala Carnegie's *Gospel of Wealth*. i saw the movement as populated by libertarian, race realist weirdos like The Caroline Ellison Herself, whose unsurprisingly-defunct [Tumblr blog](https://caroline.milkyeggs.com/worldoptimization) is worth a baffledly-amused read. 

yet i continue to find myself reading EA blogs, doing EA fellowships, and participating in EA causes. i recently attended an EA "retreat", which i found rewarding, although exhausting---EA people are usually stubborn and single minded, very often autistic/neurodivergent, or somehow socially off-putting to most of the population. there's certainly truth to the idea that EA has somewhat of a r/iamverysmart superiority complex and a harmful fixation on quantifying moral realities. of course, many (but not most!) EAs care little for political action, relying on the inherently fallible system of private charity as a primary means to "do good". in some ways, the attendees of the retreat (myself included) represented these impulses, but they were also highly curious and passionate people whose dedication to the movement stemmed from rarely high levels of genuine empathy. i feel that these characteristics, representative of every EA i've personally met, are rarely mentioned in non EAs' critiques.

my post here is intended to reconcile these perspectives: i argue that **although EA is a flawed movement and in many ways a flawed ideology, there is a significant number of people whose greatest potential benefits to society are unleashed through EA**---hence, EA's instrumental value is hugely underrated by non EAs. by sharing aspects of EA i believe to be underdiscussed outside the movement, i hope to provide both EAs and non EAs a better idea of how best to move forward with their altruism---"effective" or not.

**What do we do with STEM majors?**

everyone has been decrying the death of the humanities since the 80s, and that in itself is an essay post all on its own. the point is that as a result of this decline of humanistic thinking on every level of schooling, more and more people funneled into elite institutions---universities, companies, etc.---

1) enter university (or even high school!!) with the specific goal of breaking into prestigious, lucrative money-moving careers (ie. quant, IB) that don't do much but passively harm the world.
2) lack and are not given a humanities foundation, which (hot take) teaches important things like ethics, moral philosophy, historical contextualization for current society, etc.
3) think far more quantitatively than qualitatively.

given this, it's no surprise that the philosophy of EA---a movement populated in large part by STEM students and graduates---can feel immature to well-read humanist outsiders. EA is founded on impartial utilitarianism, statistics, weighing expected values---the same factors drawing its adherents are what makes it seem [cold, ghoulishly detached](https://thespinoff.co.nz/politics/08-04-2019/in-search-of-a-way-to-do-good-that-amounts-to-more-than-feeling-good), [neoliberal](https://jacobin.com/2023/01/effective-altruism-longtermism-nick-bostrom-racism). these are of course valid criticisms, but the non-EA should remember that not everyone---especially not the types of STEM majors i'm describing---wants to dedicate themselves to principled 

everyone agrees that a plurality of society's smartest young people should not be striving for lives as consultants or weapons engineers, and until something better comes along (ie. a total restructuring of higher education), EA seems like the best way to achieve that.
