**i sometimes feel that i have a very unique vantage point on effective altruism**, a movement which has ballooned in notoriety over the past several years (*for some very not good reasons*). as a teenager i was one of *those* really annoying socialists (as opposed to the only moderately annoying socialist i am now). like everyone else, i had first heard of EA through the FTX/Sam Bankman-Fried debacle, a cascade of disasters that i observed with digital popcorn in hand. i saw EA as just another turn to private charity meant to justify the inherent inequalities of capitalism ala Carnegie's *Gospel of Wealth*. i saw the movement as populated by libertarian, race realist weirdos like The Caroline Ellison  Herself, whose unsurprisingly-defunct [Tumblr blog](https://caroline.milkyeggs.com/worldoptimization) is worth a baffledly-amused read. even my cringeworthy teenage poetry consisted of lines like this:

> In your mystic blueprints dreams persist: 
> Forever-replenishing fountains of youth and health, 
> New technology, shared prosperity and personal wealth--- 
> Now-grown children’s visions of future, which you insist 
> Is forged only by billionaire effective altruists. 
> Remember your promises: 24/7 blood-tests! Do-it-yourself! 
> Personalized algorithms---data-mining with the utmost stealth! 
> Organic! Plant-based! Sustainable! Hot air fueling a rocket ship. 
> 
> Someday, your hyperloops will decay to mere grime: 
> For how can myopic radishes breed a next generation 
> Of artificially-enlightened philosopher-kings? 
> You survive off peripheral lithium, a basilisk’s mercy, and borrowed time. 
> Zimbardo’s hypothesis needs a software update: Stanford is a prison, 
> And you are all trapped inside, still pretending.
