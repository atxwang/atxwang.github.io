**i sometimes feel that i have a very unique vantage point on effective altruism**. as a teenager i was one of those really annoying socialists (as opposed to the only moderately annoying socialist i am now). i had first heard of EA through the FTX/Sam Bankman-Fried debacle, a cascade of disasters that i observed with digital popcorn in hand, and i saw it as just another turn to private charity meant to justify the inherent inequalities of capitalism ala Carnegie's *Gospel of Wealth*. i saw the movement as populated by libertarian, race realist weirdos like The Caroline Ellison Herself, whose unsurprisingly-defunct [Tumblr blog](https://caroline.milkyeggs.com/worldoptimization) is worth a baffledly-amused read. 

yet i continue to find myself reading EA/EA-adjacent blogs, doing EA fellowships, and participating in EA/longtermist causes. i recently attended an EA "retreat", which i found rewarding although exhausting. i think a slightly different person in the same situation would be livetweeting their stereotypically cringe interactions with the multiple regular soylent drinkers, people who could feasibly be called climate change deniers, and militant vegans whom i met.

i also met some very cool, dedicated, passionate people who reinvigorated my willingness to "do good". the intersection of this group with the aforementioned negative stereotypes was non-zero. i guess what i'm saying is **i feel confident enough now to defend EA's instrumental value to my fellow EA haters.**
